<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<h1>Diggers Beach Volleyball</h1>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>To increase revenue, customer and competition audience volume for Diggers Beach Volleyball by instilling interest in the website's visitors and giving interested parties a better understanding of the client's services and activities. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Other advertisment methods will be kept constant so that the website's implementation will be the main variable for any changes in revenue and traffic. </p>
<p>Since the majority of the audience affected will be from the younger age group, changes in revenue and traffic should be compared based on notable schooling periods (e.g. total revenue during the summer break after the website's implementation is compared with those of the previous  summer breaks). </p>
<p>Customers will also be prompted to share their source from which they learnt of Diggers Beach Volleyball. If the percentage of customers who indicated the website is similar to the percentage increase in revenue and traffic, we can attribute the increase to the website's implementation.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Mostly those of the younger age group, such as high school students and young adults. </p>
<p>Since there is a higher probability of the site being viewed on a mobile device considering the age range of the target audience, the site should have a fluid layout so that it can be viewed properly on smaller screens with different resolutions. </p>
<p>A fun-looking but still stylish, clean and user-friendly site would be ideal for this age group as they are more critical of aethestics without disregarding the site's functionality and ease of usage. </p>
